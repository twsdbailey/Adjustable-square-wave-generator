# Adjustable-square-wave-generator
Simple adjustable and scalable function generator


Simple trim-pot adjustable square wave generator that produces a square wave @ 50% duty-cycle. 
Code example is written to be used with ATtiny-85. Set internal oscillator to 16Mhz when uploading code.
Put 10K trim-pot on pin 3 (A2).  Min and max periods are in milliseconds, and can be scaled to the desired 
adjustable frequency range.
